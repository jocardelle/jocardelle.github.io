In this project we will use data surrounding bathymetry, sea surface temperature (SST), and Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ) to determine west coast areas suitable for marine aquaculture. We will specifically explore areas suitable for oysters and spiny lobsters."

The HOLC would rate neighborhoods (A - green, B - blue, C- yellow, or D - red) by âresidential securityâ in various American cities. These ratings were often based on racial segregation and would then block access to loans for homeowners (Gee, G.C. ). In this analysis we will explore the effects of redlining on health, economy, and environment today.\n\nLoad packages\n\n\nShow the code\n# Load libraries\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(here)\nlibrary(tmap)\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(kableExtra)\nlibrary(testthat)"

According to Ellis-Soto et al., previously redlined are often underrepresented in biodiversity data collection. However, the results from this table and graph show that the highest percent of bird observations within redlined neighborhoods in LA County were seen in grade C neighborhoods, followed by grade D, then grade B and A, respectively. However, once we visualized the data based on bird observations per square kilometer, the results better matched the expected outcomes. This visualization showed grade B to have the highest bird observations and grade D to have the lowest."

    "text": "About\nThe Thomas Fire, which burned across Santa Barbara and Ventura counties in December 2017, has been one of Californiaâs largest wildfires, devastating over 280,000 acres of land. The fire started on December 4, 2017 and was considered contained on January 2, 2018. In this task, I first used Air Quality Index (AQI) data from the US Environmental Protection Agency to visualize the impact on the AQI of the 2017 Thomas Fire in Santa Barbara County. I then visualized the effects of the fire on the land through using true and false color imagery.\n\n\nPalm trees are consumed by the Thomas Fire. Photo credit: Marcus Yam / Los Angeles Times"

I then found the size of each data frame; aqi_17 has 326801 rows and 10 colums and aqi_18 has 327541 rows and 10 columns. Next, I looked at the number of unique State Name in each data frame. Both had 54 states included. Since there are only 50 states, I next looked at the unique names for each state in the data frame. For both data frames the 4 extras are Country of Mexico, District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and Virgin Islands.\n\n\nCombine data frames\nThe data frames are currently separate and I want them to be combined on top of each other. This can be achieved using the pandas function pd.concat().\n\naqi = pd.concat([aqi_17, aqi_18])\n\n\n\nData cleaning\nFrom our initial data exploration, I viewed that there were column names with capital letters and spaces. I can tidy the data so all column names are in lower snake case.\n\n# Initial column names\nprint(aqi.columns, '\\n')\n\n# Simplify column names\naqi.columns = (aqi.columns\n                  .str.lower()\n                  .str.replace(' ','_')\n                )\n\n# New column names\nprint(aqi.columns, '\\n')\n\nIndex(['State Name', 'county Name', 'State Code', 'County Code', 'Date', 'AQI',\n       'Category', 'Defining Parameter', 'Defining Site',\n       'Number of Sites Reporting'],\n      dtype='object') \n\nIndex(['state_name', 'county_name', 'state_code', 'county_code', 'date', 'aqi',\n       'category', 'defining_parameter', 'defining_site',\n       'number_of_sites_reporting'],\n      dtype='object') \n\n\n\n\n\nSelecting data\nI want to select data of interest for this project which was from just Santa Barbara county. I then remove the state_name, county_name, state_code and county_code columns to leave just the date, aqi, category, defining_parameter, defining_stie, and number_of_sites_reporting columns.\n\n# Create new variable with only Santa Barbara county info \naqi_sb = aqi[aqi['county_name'] == 'Santa Barbara']\n\n# Remove `state_name`, `county_name`, `state_code` and `county_code`\naqi_sb = aqi_sb.drop(['state_name', 'county_name', 'state_code', 'county_code'], axis=1)\n\nNext I wanted to ensure the date column is a pandas.datetime object.

This is consistent with the time of the Thomas Fire, which took place from December 4, 2017 - January 2, 2018."

The bands included in this true color image are red, green, and blue. The Thomas Fire of 2017 boundary is outlined shown in blue. From this true color image, you can not see any impact of the fire. The area where the fire took place looks similar to surrounding areas. This satellite imagery was from 1/26/2018 and the Thomas Fire started 12/4/2017 and was contained on 1/12/2018.

The bands included in this false color image are short wave infared(SWIR), near infared(NIR), and red. The Thomas Fire of 2017 boundary is outlined shown in blue. Compared to the true color image, you can see a drastic difference in areas where the fire took place and areas that were not burned. Recently burned areas appear red due to the fact that they highly reflect shortwave infared. You can see the red inside the Thomas Fire boundary. This satellite imagery was from 1/26/2018 and the Thomas Fire started 12/4/2017 and was contained on 1/12/2018.

In this notebook we investigate the impacts of the increase on biodiversity by analyzing the changes in Biodiversity Intactness Index(BII).\n\n\nHighlights\n\nSearching for data using the Microsoft Planetary Computerâs(MPC) STAC API\nClipping large raster to detailed geometry using rio.clip()\nMap making using matplotlib\n\n\n\nAbout the data\nThe first dataset is the Biodiversity Intactness Index(BII) Time Series. This data comes from the Microsoft Planetary Computer STAC catalog. In the analysis we use the 2017 and 2020 rasters.\nThe second dataset is the Census Bureau County Subdivisions shapefile for Arizona. The Phoenix subdivision was downloaded from this shapefile.\nAn ESRI National Geographic style world basemap was used to show the Phoenix subdivision in its broader geographic context.\n\n\nReferences\n\nMicrosoft Planetary Computer.

Yet, these maps are often years out of date by the time they are available to scientists and policy-makers. The datasets in this STAC Collection build on past studies that map Biodiversity Intactness using the [PREDICTS database](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ece3.2579) of spatially referenced observations of biodiversity across 32,000 sites from over 750 studies. The approach differs from previous work by modeling the relationship between observed biodiversity metrics and contemporary, global, geospatial layers of human pressures, with the intention of providing a high resolution monitoring product into the future.\n\nBiodiversity intactness is estimated as a combination of two metrics: Abundance, the quantity of individuals, and Compositional Similarity, how similar the composition of species is to an intact baseline. Linear mixed effects models are fit to estimate the predictive capacity of spatial datasets of human pressures on each of these metrics and project results spatially across the globe. These methods, as well as comparisons to other leading datasets and guidance on interpreting results, are further explained in a methods [white

First, we viewed the io-biodiversity collection and were able to obtain its description, temporal extent, spatial extent and more. The temporal extent was 2017-01-01T00:00:00Z -  2020-12-31T23:59:59Z and the spatial extent was [-180, -90, 180, 90]. We then searched the catalog for the collection, date range, and area of interest and found there were 4 items that matched the search. After viewing the 4 items we chose the two of interest, for years 2017 and 2020.
