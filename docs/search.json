I have a passion for using data science to problem-solve issues around climate change, natural resource protection, and food security facing our agriculture industry. I also have a Bachelor of Engineering degree in civil engineering with a specialization in geotechnical engineering from McGill University, and am excited to utilize both these degrees to broaden my impact on environmental issues. Outside of work and school I love hiking, running, reading, scuba diving and traveling!"
